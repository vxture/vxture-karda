/**
 * The product front door.
 *
 * A visitor arriving at the domain has not asked for a login page - they asked
 * for the product. So the gate VERIFIES FIRST and only shows a door if that
 * fails. While the check runs it shows the design system's boot screen, which
 * waits 250ms before drawing anything: a visitor who is already signed in
 * resolves faster than that, so they never see a verifying screen at all - the
 * gate is invisible to everyone it lets through.
 *
 * Everything the gate needs arrives in ONE call (`/api/access`). That is not
 * only about latency - see the route for why two calls race - but it is also
 * what makes "come back carrying auth AND subscription" true rather than
 * aspirational: after login returns, the same single call re-resolves both.
 *
 * Reuse: a product copied from vxtpl changes `productName` and `destination`.
 * Everything else - the states, their copy, the redirect, the return-to
 * round trip - is the same for every product, which is exactly why it lives
 * here and not in a page.
